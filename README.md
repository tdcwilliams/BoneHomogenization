Matlab code for the paper:
T. D. Williams and W. J. Parnell. Effective antiplane properties of an orthotropic solid weakened by a periodic distribution of cracks. Q. J. Mech. Appl.
Math., 67(2):311-342, 2014.

Needs an additional repository:
1) git clone https://github.com/tdcwilliams/MatlabLibrary.git
2) in .bash_profile add
export MATLIBDIR=[path to the above repo]

* Scripts for the figures are in 'fig_scripts'
* Scripts for comparison with Parnell & Abrahams (2006) are in 'PA06_scripts'
* Further test scripts are in 'test_scripts'
* Main code is in 'BONE_progs'
